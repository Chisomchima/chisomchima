<p align="start">Hi there! I'm a software developer with a passion for creating scalable and user-friendly web applications. I have experience using a variety of JavaScript frameworks and technologies such as Vue.js, React, as well as Nodejs, express, Mongodb and SQL. I'm a big believer in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with a diverse team of creatives. If you're looking for someone who brings energy, enthusiasm, and a love for what they do to the table, feel free to connect with me. Let's build something amazing together! In my spare time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, traveling, teaching and writing. I'm open to new opportunities and challenges, so feel free to reach out if you want to chat about a project or just want to grab coffee!</p>
